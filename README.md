# Task Management System (CLI)
The Task Management System is a command-line interface (CLI) application that helps users efficiently organize, track, and manage their tasks. It allows users to add tasks, assign them to other users, categorize them, set priorities, and track completion status.

Built using Python, Click, and SQLAlchemy ORM, this project ensures persistent data storage and an interactive CLI experience.
